From the Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression chart, we can see that there is a relatively strong negative correlation between the latitude and the maximum temperature. However, when it comes to Southern hemisphere, the correction between the maximum temperature versus the latitude is not so strong. 

Out of the 4 figures we have generated, Fig 1 shows a stronger relationship between the latitude and the temperature, which the temperature come to the highest when it is approaching to 0 latitude. However, there is no observable pattern when latitude is comparing with the humidity, cloudiness and wind speed globally.

The wind speed is also more dependent on the latitude in the northern hemisphere when comparing to the southern hemisphere. The possible reason behind is there are less number of cities located in the souther hemisphere which causes a bias to the chart.
